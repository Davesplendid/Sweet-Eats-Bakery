Task 1: Explore the CSS.  Look at all the unique selectors.  Find things that are new to you and learn what they do.  Find properties you may not be familiar with and google them.

	a.CSS Padding: The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
	With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).
	Padding - Individual Sides
	CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:
	-padding-top
	-padding-right
	-padding-bottom
	-padding-left

	All the padding properties can have the following values:
	- length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.
	- % - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element
	- inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element
	  Note: Negative values are not allowed.
	
	b. Display Property: The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout. The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed. Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline. 

	c.border-radius: Sets all the four border-*-radius properties for rounded corners

	d. The :first-child pseudo-class: It matches a specified element that is the first child of another element.
	
	e.Text-decoration: The text-decoration property specifies the decoration added to text, and is a shorthand property for:text-decoration-line (required),text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style

	f. :hover: :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.
